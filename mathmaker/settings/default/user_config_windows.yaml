# If you wish different values, you should make a copy and
# edit your copy only.
# As a user, your copy should be stored as:
# ~/.config/mathmaker/user_config.yaml
# As a dev, your copy should be stored as:
# path/to/mathmaker/mathmaker/settings/dev/user_config.yaml
# (it will be ignored by git).
# The values redefined in a copy will override the default ones
