		<!-- No default for kind and subkind, they must be given
			 Possible variants:
			 Identified using either a natural number between 0 and 23 (included),
			 or a mix of natural numbers and ranges (compatible with intspan, see
			 https://pypi.python.org/pypi/intspan).
			 See in calculation_modules/priorities_in_calculation_*.py to know the
			 different variants.
			 If variant is not defined, it will be considered, by default, as the
			 range 0-23.
		   Possible subvariants:
			 - only_naturals: even the results must be natural numbers
		   - no variant given: numbers used will still only be positive, but the
		                       results can be negative
			 - allow_negative_numbers: random numbers will be negative
		   Depending on the exact kind of question, the numbers source can require
		   single numbers and/or pairs of numbers (for products etc.), mathmaker
		   will use as many sources as required of each type, but you must provide
		   what kind of sources must be used both for single integers and for pairs
		   of integers, so you must put TWO sources and not only one. -->
