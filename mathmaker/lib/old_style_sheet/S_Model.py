# EXAMPLE OF A SHEET NOT USING ANY LAYOUT
# -----------------------  lines_nb    col_widths   exercises
SHEET_LAYOUT = {'exc': [None, 'all'],
                'ans': [None, 'all']
                }
# ANOTHER EXAMPLE
# ------------------------  lines_nb    col_widths   exercises
# SHEET_LAYOUT = {'exc': [[1, 6, 15], (1, 1),
#                            None, 1
#                         ],
#                'ans': [[1, 6.5, 12], (1, 1),
#                            'jump',   'next_page',
#                            None, 1
#                         ]
#                }
# NOTE THAT FOR SHORT_TEST SHEETS, THE LAYOUT HAS TO BE GIVEN ONLY ONCE
# AND IT WILL BE DUPLICATED FOR THE SECOND SET OF EXERCISES

# EXPLANATION ABOUT THE EXAMPLE OF SHEET_LAYOUT:
# [1, 6, 15] means a table of 1 line with columns widths 6 and 15.
# (1, 1) means one exercise in each of these two cells.
# This tuple should contains as many numbers as nb of lines Ã— nb of cols.
# To leave one cell empty, just write 0.
# None means no tabular and the following 1 means for the 1 next exercise.
# 'all' and 'all_left' are synonym
# 'jump' and 'next_page' will include a jump to next page before the next ones

        # Instructions for use (creating a new sheet):
        # - Put its name in the header's comment
        #   & in the one of the documentation (@class)
        # - Write the @brief comment
        # - Replace Model by the chosen name
        # - Choose the values for the globals
        # - In the constructor's comment, replace Model by the chosen name at
        #   the @return line
        # - Skip to the zone to rewrite and for each exercise, follow the
        #   example (i.e. write on two lines:
        #   - ex_number_n = exercise.ThmPythagore( options...)
        #   - self.exercises_list.append(ex_number_n)
        #   and so on with ex<n+1>, ex<n+2> as many as desired)
